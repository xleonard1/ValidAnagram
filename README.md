# ValidAnagram

## Description
I was tasked with taking two strings and determining whether or not the second string was an anagram of the first string. The strings were all lowercase and spaces did not count. An anagram is a rearrangement of a word or phrase to create a new word. 
```

When the user enters two words into the ValidAnagram function they should return true if it is an anagram or false if it is not.
